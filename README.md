## Journal

* Day 10: very difficult, had to read up a lot on linear systems.
  * Most useful resource: https://interactivetextbooks.tudelft.nl/linear-algebra/Chapter2/LinearSystems.html#row-reduction-and-echelon-forms
  * Also tried dynamic programming and complete search but that was too slow.
* Day 11: easy ~1 hour
